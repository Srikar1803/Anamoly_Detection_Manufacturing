# Automated Anomaly Detection in Manufacturing

This project builds a deep-learning-based inspection system using the **MVTec AD dataset**.  
It trains autoencoders to identify and localize surface defects on industrial products.

## Setup
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/Srikar1803/Anamoly_Detection_Manufacturing.git>
cd AnomalyDetection_Manufacturing
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Dataset

**Name:** MVTec AD Dataset(https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad)  
**Description:** High-resolution industrial images across 15 object and texture categories, including both normal and defective samples.  
Each defective image includes **pixel-wise ground truth masks** for precise anomaly localization.  
The dataset is publicly available and widely used as a benchmark for industrial anomaly detection.
